Hello there and welcome to my blog! I’m a Machine Learning Researcher. I’m particularly interested in everything Bayesian, Deep Learning, Applied Math (Statistics, Optimization, Probability Theory and Stochastic Proccesses, Linear Algebra, Numerical Methods), but also like more traditional CS topics like Algorithms, Computer Security and Functional Programming.
